# Data-analyst-python-library-rework
This is a python library rework of numpy, pandas and others librarys used in data analyst work.

This is a pack of librarys that mimicthat of librarys like numpy, 
but at there core are functions that give the same result as that of librarys like numpy.


```python 

x = [1, 2, 5, 7, 8] 

# numpy 

a = np.ndim(x)

# output = 1 

# numpy_rework 

a = npr.ndim(x)

# output = 1 

```

## How to use:

First clone repo.

```bash

~$ git clone https://github.com/AdriaanNaude/Data-analyst-python-library-rework

```
Then after clonig cope required library to any folder to use library.

Remeber to import library to your .py file.

```python

```
